# Welcome

tooltiplery.js is a powerful JavaScript package for you to create your tooltip quickly and simply. You can get started by [Creating your First Tooltip](/get-started)

If you want to get started with documentation, you need to import the main script file:

Add these lines to your HTML file

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="tooltiplery.css" />
<script src="tooltiplery.js"></script>
```

or, if you use npm:

```bash
npm i tooltiplery.js
```

then include it:

```js
const tooltiplery = require("tooltiplery.js");
```

Then you can start reading the documentation.
